Concise is unit test framework for using plain English and minimal code, built
on PHPUnit.

Highlights include:

 * 100% compatible with PHPUnit, no changes required. You may use as many
   features as you like.
 * Much better mocking framework with a lot less typing.
 * Huge array of assertions to save on boilerplate code.
 * Assert and [[Verify|verify]] supported.
